Dual 1.75 inch diameter BF3 Neutron Detectors. Geometry is based off of the thesis by Dr. Scott Walker:
Spectrally Matched Neutron Detectors Designed Using Computational Adjoing SN for Plug-In Replacement of Helium-3.

Neutron source defined off Bugle-96 library, also from Dr. Walker Thesis.

Geometry:
----------------------------------------------
Dual 1.75 inch diameter, 10 cm tall BF3 neutron detectors with a 1 mm aluminum shell. The detector is surrounded by G4_Polyethylene as a neutron moderator.


Physics:
-----------------------------------------------
Recommended physics list utilizes the NeutronHP package to transport low energy neutrons (below 20 MeV). This package allows for the proper handling of elastic scattering off certain materials down to thermal energies.
